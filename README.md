#### 1. What are the common distance metrics used in distance-based classification algorithms? 
######   1. Euclidean Distance
######   2. Manhattan Distance
######   3. Minkwoski Distance
######   4. Hamming Distance
######   5.Mahalanobis distance

#### 2. What are some real-world applications of distance-based classification algorithms? 
##### Image classification,Handwritten digit recognition,Customer Segmentation,Product recommendation systems, Medical diagnosis, Text classification

#### 3. Explain various distance metrics.
######    1. Euclidean Distance:- Euclidean Distance represents the shortest distance between two vectors. It is the square root of the sum of squares of differences between corresponding elements.
######   2. Manhattan Distance:-Manhattan Distance is the sum of absolute differences between points across all the dimensions.
###### Manhattan distance in a 2-dimensional space is, d=|p1-q1|+|p2-q2|
######   3. Minkwoski Distance:-Minkowski Distance is the generalized form of Euclidean and Manhattan Distance.
######   4. Hamming Distance:- the hamming distance measures the similarity between two strings of the same length. It is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.
######   5.Mahalanobis distance:-Mahalanobis distance is a statistical measurement that determines how far a point is from a distribution

#### 4. What is the role of cross validation in model performance? 
######  Cross-validation preventing overfitting, ensures that the  model is robust, reduces bias and variance trade-offs, and helps in selecting the best-performing model for real-world deployment

#### 5. Explain variance and bias in terms of KNN? 
###### Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A high-bias model makes strong assumptions and may underfit the data.
###### Variance refers to the modelâ€™s sensitivity to small changes in the training data. A high-variance model overfits the data and performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
